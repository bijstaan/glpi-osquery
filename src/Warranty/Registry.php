/**
 * Which vendors exist, which are switched on, and how to build one.
 *
 * The list is fixed rather than discovered through a plugin hook. A warranty
 * client is not a place to accept third-party code: it is handed the estate's
 * serial numbers and a support-portal credential, and every one of these is
 * written against an API whose exact behaviour had to be established from a
 * real payload. A site that needs an eighth vendor is better served by a patch
 * than by a hook that makes the credential path pluggable.
 *
 * ### Two answer shapes
 *
 * Seven of the ten answer about a **serial**: send a batch, get a batch back.
 * Microsoft and Pure Storage answer about a **fleet** — there is no per-device
 * endpoint, so the whole tenant or organisation is fetched once per run and
 * every subject is answered from it. The interface is the same either way; a
 * fleet vendor just caches its snapshot for the life of the object and declares
 * a large batch size. Juniper offers both and uses the serial form.
 *
 * ### Vendors deliberately absent
 *
 * Each of these was looked at and has no serial-number warranty API a plugin
 * can call, as of this release:
 *
 * - **Arista Networks** — the only public API on `arista.com` is the software
 *   download service (`custom_data/api`, as used by eos-downloader), and
 *   CloudVision's APIs describe devices under management rather than support
 *   entitlement. Warranty is the support portal's serial-number page.
 * - **Ubiquiti** — `api.ui.com` and the UniFi APIs return device inventory
 *   with no coverage data; warranty runs through the RMA web form at
 *   rma.ui.com, which needs proof of purchase rather than a serial.
 * - **Supermicro** — serial-number warranty check is a web form; RMA is email.
 * - **Zebra, APC/Schneider, Acer, ASUS, MSI, Dynabook/Toshiba, Fujitsu** —
 *   web form in every case. Scraping one would break silently and is not
 *   shipped here.
 * - **Cisco Meraki** — see {@see Cisco}: Meraki serials are not in SN2INFO.
 *
 * Where a vendor later publishes an API, adding it is one class plus one line
 * in {@see vendorClasses()}; everything else keys off the interface.
