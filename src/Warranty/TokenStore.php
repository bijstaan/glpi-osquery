 * Only Apple needs this, and it needs it badly: GSX hands out an *activation*
 * token that can be exchanged exactly once for a session token, and the
 * session token is then the only way in until it lapses. Holding that in
 * memory for the length of a cron run would burn the activation token on the
 * first run and lock the instance out on the second.
 *
 * An interface rather than a direct write to `glpi_configs` so the Apple
 * client stays free of GLPI, and so the token round trip can be tested.
