/**
 * Warranty-lookup configuration.
 *
 * Scoped to this feature rather than being a settings class for the whole
 * plugin, because the rest of the plugin reads `glpi_configs` directly and
 * rewriting that was not this change's job.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing.
 *
 * **Everything is off and no vendor is configured.** Enabling the plugin must
 * never be what starts sending an estate's serial numbers to seven companies.
 * Each vendor is a separate switch on top of a master switch, because a site
 * may hold a Dell contract and have no arrangement at all with the others.
 *
 * **Credentials are encrypted by core, not by this class.** The keys returned
 * by {@see secretKeys()} are declared through the SECURED_CONFIGS hook in
 * setup.php, which is what makes `Config::setConfigurationValues()` encrypt
 * them on write, mask them in the history log, and re-encrypt them when an
 * administrator runs `glpi:security:changekey`. Doing it by hand here would
 * work until that rotation, and then silently orphan every key at once.
