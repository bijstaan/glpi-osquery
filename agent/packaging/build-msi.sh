#   ./packaging/build-msi.sh <version> <arch>        # arch: amd64 | arm64
#
# Built with wixl, from GNOME's msitools:
#
#   apt-get install wixl        # note: a *separate* package from msitools,
#                               # which ships msiinfo/msibuild but not wixl
#
# wixl rather than the WiX Toolset for two reasons. WiX only ever emits an MSI
# on Windows, so a release could not be built in one place alongside everything
# else; and from v6 it requires accepting the Open Source Maintenance Fee EULA,
# with a fee due above a revenue threshold. wixl is LGPL, native, and has
# neither problem.
#
# Signing is opt-in and needs osslsigncode:
#
#   SIGN_PFX       path to a code-signing certificate
#   SIGN_PASSWORD  its password
#   SIGN_TIMESTAMP RFC-3161 timestamp URL (default DigiCert's)
#
# Without them you get an unsigned MSI: fine for testing, but SmartScreen warns
# on it and many fleets refuse unsigned installers outright.
