/**
 * Projects a vendor's answer onto GLPI's own warranty fields.
 *
 * The instruction this feature was built to satisfy is that warranty data
 * lives in the *native* asset fields rather than in a plugin table nobody else
 * can report on — so this writes `glpi_infocoms`, and everything downstream
 * (the Financial tab, the warranty-expiry search options, GLPI's own expiry
 * alert cron, the dashboards, CSV export) works with no further help.
 *
 * ### The shape mismatch, and how it is resolved
 *
 * GLPI stores a warranty as **a start date plus a number of months**, and
 * computes the expiry as `warranty_date + warranty_duration months`. Vendors
 * report **a start date and an end date**, several of them at once, and one of
 * the seven reports an end date with no start at all.
 *
 * Three rules follow, and each of them is a decision rather than an obvious
 * translation:
 *
 * 1. **The entitlement that ends last wins.** A machine with a base warranty
 *    and a ProSupport extension is covered until the extension ends; that is
 *    the date the field is asked about. The whole list is kept on the lookup
 *    record so the choice can be audited.
 *
 * 2. **The duration is whole months, rounded down, and the exact end date goes
 *    into `warranty_info`.** A three-year warranty is thirty-six months on the
 *    nose, so this is exact in almost every real case. Where a vendor's span
 *    is not a whole number of months, GLPI's computed expiry lands a few days
 *    early — which errs towards warning sooner, and the true date is still on
 *    the record and in the info string.
 *
 *    Worth knowing, because it looks like an off-by-one bug and is not ours:
 *    **GLPI computes this expiry two different ways and they differ by a day.**
 *    The search option "Warranty expiration date" and the warranty-alert cron
 *    both use `DATE_ADD(warranty_date, INTERVAL warranty_duration MONTH)`, which
 *    lands exactly on the vendor's end date. The Financial information tab
 *    subtracts one day from that, to show the last day that is still covered.
 *    Reporting and alerting — the two that matter operationally — are therefore
 *    exact, and the tab reads one day earlier by GLPI's own convention.
 *
 * 3. **A coverage with no start is written as a zero-month span ending on the
 *    right day.** Cisco reports expiry without a start. Writing
 *    `warranty_date = <end>, duration = 0` makes every expiry view and every
 *    alert correct. It does leave the "start" column holding the end date,
 *    which is why the info string says so explicitly — the alternative was to
 *    invent a purchase date for every switch in the estate.
 *
 * ### What it will not do
 *
 * It does not touch a warranty somebody typed in. The signature of what this
 * plugin last wrote is kept on the lookup record; if the Infocom no longer
 * matches it, a human has edited those fields and the lookup is recorded but
 * not applied, unless an administrator has explicitly allowed overwriting.
 * The same goes for the purchase date and the supplier, which are finance's
 * fields and are only ever filled in when empty.
